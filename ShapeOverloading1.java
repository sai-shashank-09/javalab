//Program to create a class named 'Shape' with a method to print This is This is shape. Then create two other classes named Rectangle, Circle inheriting the Shape class, both having a method to print This is rectangular shape and This is circular shape respectively. Create a subclass Square of Rectangle having a method to print Square is a rectangle. Now call the method of Shape and Rectangle class by the object of Square class.
